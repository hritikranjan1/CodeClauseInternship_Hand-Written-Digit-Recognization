# Code_Clause-HandWritten-Digit_Recognization
The capacity of computers to recognise human handwritten digits is known as handwritten digit recognition. 
Because handwritten numerals are imperfect and can be generated with a variety of flavours, it is a difficult work for the machine. The answer to this issue is handwritten digit recognition, which uses an image of a digit to identify the digit that is contained in the image.
In this Project I had successfully implement the handwritten digit recognition using numpy,matplotlib,sklearn and obtained the desire output.
