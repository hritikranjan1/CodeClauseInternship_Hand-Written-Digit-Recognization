# Code_Clause-HandWritten-Digit_Recognization
The capacity of computers to recognise human handwritten digits is known as handwritten digit recognition. 
Because handwritten numerals are imperfect and can be generated with a variety of flavours, it is a difficult work for the machine. The answer to this issue is handwritten digit recognition, which uses an image of a digit to identify the digit that is contained in the image.
In this Project I had successfully implement the handwritten digit recognition using numpy,matplotlib,sklearn and obtained the desire output.
# K-Nearest Neighbors Digit Classification

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to recognize handwritten digits from the popular [Digits dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html) provided by the scikit-learn library. The model is trained and evaluated on the dataset, and it provides visual feedback of its predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/knn-digit-classification.git
   cd knn-digit-classification
Install the required packages:

bash

    pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

2.Usage

  Run the script:
  
    python knn_digit_classification.py

The script will load the Digits dataset, train the KNN model, and print the accuracy of the classifier. It will also display a visual representation of some sample predictions made by the model.

3.Navigate to the cloned directory:

bash

    cd Code_Clause-HandWritten-Digit_Recognization


4.Create a new file named README.md and paste the above content into it.
Add your Python script (let's say you name it knn_digit_classification.py) to the repository.
Stage your changes:

bash

    git add README.md knn_digit_classification.py

5.Commit your changes:

bash

    git commit -m "Add K-Nearest Neighbors digit classification project"

6Push your changes to GitHub:

bash

    git push origin main
